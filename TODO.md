-   [ ] default-config.js shouldn't be conflated with a template-config file. Create a new template config file, reference that in README, don't mention default-config.js when talking about customizing to use-cases.
    -   [ ] TODO: Move default into src, leave template in the config dir
-   [ ] More careful language when discussing how configs (default + custom + CLI args) get combined. Avoid confusion.
-   [x] "auto" should be used as a keyword for autodetecting tokenurls; empty string and 'none' should be code for open server
-   [ ] Maybe find a good link for JWK documentation and hyperlink.
